1.05

 * New option --version. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Terminate early if there is no sufficient budget to run irace with
   the given settings. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The option --parallel (without --mpi) now works under Windows.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Pablo Valledor Pellicer for testing
   it)

 * Improved error handling when running under Rmpi. Now irace will
   terminate as soon as the master node detects at least one failed
   slave node. This avoids irace reporting two times the same error.
   Also, irace will print all the unique errors returned by all slaves
   and not just the first one.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Forbidden configurations may be specified in terms of constraints
   on their values. Forbidden configurations will never be evaluated by irace. 
   See --forbidden-file and inst/templates/forbidden.tmpl.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New option --recovery-file (recoveryFile) allows resuming a
   previous irace run. (Leslie Perez)

 * The confidence level for the elimination test is now
   configurable with parameter --confidence. (Leslie Perez)

 * Much more robust handling of relative/absolute paths. Improved support
   for Windows. (Leslie Perez, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Provide better error messages for incorrect parameter
   descriptions. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)
    Examples:

    x "" i (0, 0)       # lower and upper bounds are the same
    x "" r (1e-4, 5e-4) # given digits=2, ditto
    x "" i (-1, -2)     # lower bound must be smaller than upper bound
    x "" c ("a", "a")   # duplicated values
 
 * Print elapsed time for calls to hook-run if debugLevel >=1.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * examples/hook-run-python/hook-run: A multi-purpose hook-run written
   in Python. (Franco Mascia)

 * Parallel mode in an SGE cluster (--sge-cluster) is more
   robust. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

1.04

 * Replace obsolete package multicore by package parallel
   (requires R >= 2.14.0)

 * Use load-balancing (mc.preschedule = FALSE) in mclapply.

1.03

 * Use reg.finalizer to finish Rmpi properly without clobbering
   .Last().

 * Remove uses of deprecated as.real().

 * Nicer error handling in readParameters.

 * Add hypervolume (multi-objective) example.

 * Fix several bugs in the computation of similar candidates.

1.02

 * More concise output.

 * The parameters expName and expDescription are now useless and they
   were removed.

 * Faster computation of similar candidates (Jeremie Dubois-Lacoste
   and Leslie Perez).

 * Fix bug when saving instances in tunerResults$experiments.

 * irace.cmdline ("--help") does not try to quit R anymore.

1.01

 * Fix bug caused by file.exists (and possibly other functions)
   not handling directory names with a trailing backslash or slash on
   Windows.
 
 * Fix bug using per-instance parameters (Leslie Perez).

 * Fix bug when reading initial candidates from a file.
